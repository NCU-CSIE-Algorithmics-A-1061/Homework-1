# Problem

How to implement merge-sort such that the extra space used is about n/2 where n is the number of input elements?

# Assume

We use button-up approach:

```
loop( A's length from i=2 to the number of input elements n)
{
  Array A(declare A[i]) is the original unsorted array which has stored two sorted groups of elements
  respectively in A[0]~A[i/2] and A[i/2+1]~A[i].
  i=i*2.
}
```

For example,<br>
if length i=2, A have two sorted array, which is A[0] and A[1], respectively.<br>
If length i=4, A have two sorted array(sorted from previous step), which is A[0]~A[1] and A[2]~A[3], respectively.<br>
......<br>
If length i=n, A have two sorted array(sorted from previous step), which is A[0]~A[n/2] and A[n/2+1]~A[n], respectively.<br>
The merge sort is done.

# Solution

Since we have to merge the two sorted groups of elements (A[0]~A[n/2] and A[n/2+1]~A[n] ) into one, we can copy A[0]~A[n/2] to a new array B(declare B[n/2]) and discard data in A[0]~A[n/2].<br>
Then merge the two sorted groups of elements A[n/2+1]~A[m] and B[0]~B[n/2] and put results one by one into A from index 0 to index n

# Conclution

The extra space for this kind of implement of merge sort is array B, whose length is only the half of the original array A.<br>
A’s length is the number of input elements n<br>
The extra space used is about n/2

*Note: 每次只會發生一個合併，所以當這次合併好後就可以釋放記憶體供下個合併時所需的額外記憶體用。<br>
而當在合併A[0]~A[n/2]和A[n/2+1]~A[n] (n是input大小)時所需的額外空間最大(n/2)，所以額外花的空間是n/2。
