# Problem

Prove that each of the following sorting algorithms is stable or show that it is unstable by giving a counter example; moreover, determine whether it is in place: bubble sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort and heap-sort.

# Solution

## Stable or not

- Bubble sort
    - For every big step, only the biggest value will be moved to the right-most side of the list. So if right priority method is used during comparing and swapping, the order of the same value in the original list will still be the same. The remaining original order will keep in order for the next step of sorting, so it is **stable**.
- Insertion sort
    - For every big step, only the left-most element of the unsorted part will be inserted to the sorted part of the list. Right priority method used when inserting will keep the original order of unsorted list into the sorted list. The remaining original order will still keep in order for the next step of sorting, so it is **stable**.
- Quick sort
    - There are couple versions of quick sort, but lets just talk about the typical one.(in-place version)
    - For every step, it made a swap. As during these steps, the unsorted part(the remaining list) will be out of order.
    - E.g. 1<sub>1</sub>, 1<sub>2</sub>, 3<sub>1</sub>, 3<sub>2</sub>, ùüê => 1<sub>1</sub>, 1<sub>2</sub>, ùüê, 3<sub>2</sub>, 3<sub>1</sub>
    - No matter how you prioritize the rules, one of the sides will still be out of order, so it is **unstable**.
- Merge sort
    - After dividing it to the smallest part(1 value), every element‚Äôs left-right correlation didn‚Äôt change. As the same will happen when merging the lists if the list on the left is using left priority rule. So as a result, it is **stable**.
- Heap sort
    - After filling the list into the tree structure(it is actually an array, we understand the concept by projecting it to a tree structure), the left hand side will always be prioritized. When ever there are more then 3 same value elements, and 2 or more elements among them are initial in the left hand side, they will be out of order. So it is a **unstable** sorting algorithm.

## In-place or not

- Bubble sort
    - During the sorting steps, it only swap in the original list. No extra storage is needed, so it is **in-place**.
- Insertion sort
    - During the sorting steps, the storage size that the unsorted part decrease is the same as the storage size that the sorted part increase. So it can be done **in-place**.
- Quick sort
    - In average case: During the sorting steps, it only swap in the original list. Because it need to use the concept of recursive, so the extra space complexity is O(log(n)). According to wiki‚Äôs broadly definition of in-place, it is an **in-place** algorithm. (**out-of-place** with wiki‚Äôs strictest definition)
- Merge sort
    - It is known to be an **out-of-place** algorithm because people usually use another list to save the sorted list.
- Heap sort
    - During the sorting steps, it only swap in the original list, No extra storage is needed, so it is **in-place**.
